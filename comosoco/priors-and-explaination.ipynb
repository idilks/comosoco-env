    "\n",

You could model how inference is affected by observing one gesture (which could be more easily explained away as noisy movement production) versus multiple similar gestures (which could imply a deliberate signal). You could convert a binary variable into a discretized linear variable (e.g. turn Gesture into a perceptual similarity metric that express how confusable a gesture is with a fascist salute). Maybe the observers didn’t see the video but rather heard about it from someone they have differing degrees of trust in (see Jaynes, 2003, and also the exercise below) – perhaps the observers think the person tends to be hyperbolic or understated, or maybe the person is in their ingroup or outgroup.\n",
