    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(I, D, G)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- $I$ represents ideology,  \n",
    "- $D$ represents demeanor,  \n",
    "- $G$ represents gesture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each observer has a prior belief about ideology. The first observer assumes a uniform prior $ P(I = \\text{fascism}) = 0.5 $, while the second observer assumes an unlikely prior $ P(I = \\text{fascism}) = 0.01 $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second model, we aim to infer the latent causes, eg. getting the **posterior probability** of ideology and demeanor given a gesture:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(I, D \\mid G) = \\frac{P(I, D, G)}{P(G)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows directly from Bayes' rule, where:  \n",
    "- The **prior** is $ P(I, D) $,  \n",
    "- The **likelihood** is $ P(G \\mid I, D) $ (how likely a gesture is given ideology and demeanor),  \n",
    "- The **posterior** is $ P(I, D \\mid G) $ (updated belief after observing the gesture).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, moving from model 1 to model 2 involves conditioning on the gesture. This operation normalizes the joint probability over all possible values of \\( I \\) and \\( D \\), ensuring that the posterior sums to 1:  \n",

You could model how inference is affected by observing one gesture (which could be more easily explained away as noisy movement production) versus multiple similar gestures (which could imply a deliberate signal). You could convert a binary variable into a discretized linear variable (e.g. turn Gesture into a perceptual similarity metric that express how confusable a gesture is with a fascist salute). Maybe the observers didn’t see the video but rather heard about it from someone they have differing degrees of trust in (see Jaynes, 2003, and also the exercise below) – perhaps the observers think the person tends to be hyperbolic or understated, or maybe the person is in their ingroup or outgroup.\n",
